      "in the Isle of Eressea; and there is in that land a haven that \n",
      "is named Avallone, for it is of all cities the nearest to \n",
      "Valinor, and the tower of Avallone is the first sight that the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the waters glittered before the eyes of the Edain like \n",
      "rippling glass, and the foam flew like snow before the \n",
      "stems of their ships. But so bright was Rothinzil that even at \n",
      "morning Men could see it glimmering in the West, and in \n",
      "the cloudless night it shone alone, for no other star could \n",
      "stand beside it. And setting their course towards it the \n",
      "Edain came at last over leagues of sea and saw afar the \n",
      "land that was prepared for them, Andor, the Land of Gift, \n",
      "shimmering in a golden haze. Then they went up out of the \n",
      "sea and found a country fair and fruitful, and they were glad. \n",
      "And they called that land Elenna, which is Starwards; but \n",
      "also Anadune, which is Westernesse, Numenore in the \n",
      "High Eldarin tongue. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was the beginning of that people that in the Grey- \n",
      "elven speech are called the Dunedain: the Numenoreans, \n",
      "Kings among Men. But they did not thus escape from the \n",
      "doom of death that lluvatar had set upon all Mankind, and \n",
      "they were mortal still, though their years were long, and they \n",
      "knew no sickness, ere the shadow fell upon them. \n",
      "Therefore they grew wise and glorious, and in all things \n",
      "more like to the Firstborn than any other of the kindreds of \n",
      "Men; and they were tall, taller than the tallest of the sons of \n",
      "Middle-earth; and the light of their eyes was like the bright \n",
      "stars. But their numbers increased only slowly in the land, \n",
      "for though daughters and sons were born to them, fairer \n",
      "than their fathers, yet their children were few. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of old the chief city and haven of Numenor was in the \n",
      "midst of its western coasts, and it was called Andunie \n",
      "because it faced the sunset. But in the midst of the land \n",
      "was a mountain tall and steep, and it was named the \n",
      "Meneltarma, the Pillar of Heaven, and upon it was a high \n",
      "place that was hallowed to Eru lluvatar, and it was open and \n",
      "unroofed, and no other temple or fane was there in the land \n",
      "of the Numenoreans. At the feet of the mountain were built \n",
      "the tombs of the Kings, and hard by upon a hill was \n",
      "Armenelos, fairest of cities, and there stood the tower and \n",
      "the citadel that was raised by Elros son of Earendil, whom \n",
      "the Valar appointed to be the first King of the Dunedain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Elros and Elrond his brother were descended \n",
      "from the Three Houses of the Edain, but in part also both \n",
      "from the Eldar and the Maiar; for Idril of Gondolin and \n",
      "Luthien daughter of Melian were their fore-mothers. The \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valar indeed may not withdraw the gift of death, which \n",
      "comes to Men from lluvatar, but in the matter of the Half- \n",
      "elven lluvatar gave to them the judgement; and they judged \n",
      "that to the sons of Earendil should be given choice of their \n",
      "own destiny. And Elrond chose to remain with the Firstborn, \n",
      "and to him the life of the Firstborn was granted. But to \n",
      "Elros, who chose to be a king of Men, still a great span of \n",
      "years was allotted, many times that of the Men of Middle- \n",
      "earth; and all his line, the kings and lords of the royal house, \n",
      "had long life even according to the measure of the \n",
      "Numenoreans. But Elros lived five hundred years, and ruled \n",
      "the Numenoreans four hundred years and ten. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the years passed, and while Middle-earth went \n",
      "backward and light and wisdom faded, the Dunedain dwelt \n",
      "under the protection of the Valar and in the friendship of the \n",
      "Eldar, and they increased in stature both of mind and body. \n",
      "For though this people used still their own speech, their \n",
      "kings and lords knew and spoke also the Elven tongue, \n",
      "which they had learned in the days of their alliance, and \n",
      "thus they held converse still with the Eldar, whether of \n",
      "Eressea or of the west-lands of Middle-earth. And the \n",
      "loremasters among them learned also the High Eldarin \n",
      "tongue of the Blessed Realm, in which much story and song \n",
      "was preserved from the beginning of the world; and they \n",
      "made letters and scrolls and books, and wrote in them \n",
      "many things of wisdom and wonder in the high tide of their \n",
      "realm, of which all is now forgot. So it came to pass that, \n",
      "beside their own names, all the lords of the Numenoreans \n",
      "had also Eldarin names; and the like with the cities and fair \n",
      "places that they founded in Numenor and on the shores of \n",
      "the Hither Lands. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the Dunedain became mighty in crafts, so that if \n",
      "they had had the mind they could easily have surpassed the \n",
      "evil kings of Middle-earth in the making of war and the \n",
      "forging of weapons; but they were become men of peace. \n",
      "Above all arts they nourished shipbuilding and sea-craft, \n",
      "and they became mariners whose like shall never be again \n",
      "since the world was diminished; and voyaging upon the \n",
      "wide seas was the chief feat and adventure of their hardy \n",
      "men in the gallant days of their youth. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Lords of Valinor forbade them to sail so far \n",
      "westward that the coasts of Numenor could no longer be \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "seen; and for long the Dunedain were content, though they \n",
      "did not fully understand the purpose of this ban. But the \n",
      "design of Manwe was that the Numenoreans should not be \n",
      "tempted to seek for the Blessed Realm, nor desire to \n",
      "overpass the limits set to their bliss, becoming enamoured \n",
      "of the immortality of the Valar and the Eldar and the lands \n",
      "where all things endure. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For in those days Valinor still remained in the world \n",
      "visible, and there lluvatar permitted the Valar to maintain \n",
      "upon Earth an abiding place, a memorial of that which \n",
      "might have been if Morgoth had not cast his shadow on the \n",
      "world. This the Numenoreans knew full well; and at times, \n",
      "when all the air was clear and the sun was in the east, they \n",
      "would look out and descry far off in the west a city white- \n",
      "shining on a distant shore, and a great harbour and a \n",
      "tower. For in those days the Numenoreans were far- \n",
      "sighted; yet even so it was only the keenest eyes among \n",
      "them that could see this vision, from the Meneltarma, \n",
      "maybe, or from some tall ship that lay off their western \n",
      "coast as far as it was lawful for them to go. For they did not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "dare to break the Ban of the Lords of the West. But the \n",
      "wise among them knew that this distant land was not \n",
      "indeed the Blessed Realm of Valinor, but was Avallone, the \n",

      "Undying Lands. And thence at times the Firstborn still \n",
      "would come sailing to Numenor in oarless boats, as white \n",
      "birds flying from the sunset. And they brought to Numenor \n",
      "many gifts: birds of song, and fragrant flowers, and herbs of \n",
      "great virtue. And a seedling they brought of Celeborn, the \n",
      "White Tree that grew in the midst of Eressea; and that was \n",
      "in its turn a seedling of Galathilion the Tree of Tuna, the \n",
      "image of Telperion that Yavanna gave to the Eldar in the \n",

      "with its fragrance. \n",

      "Thus it was that because of the Ban of the Valar the \n",
      "voyages of the Dunedain in those days went ever eastward \n",
      "and not westward, from the darkness of the North to the \n",
      "heats of the South, and beyond the South to the Nether \n",
      "Darkness; and they came even into the inner seas, and \n",
      "sailed about Middle-earth and glimpsed from their high \n",
      "prows the Gates of Morning in the East. And the Dunedain \n",
      "came at times to the shores of the Great Lands, and they \n",
      "took pity on the forsaken world of Middle-earth; and the \n",
      "Lords of Numenor set foot again upon the western shores \n",
      "in the Dark Years of Men, and none yet dared to withstand \n",
      "them. For most of the Men of that age that sat under the \n",
      "Shadow were now grown weak and fearful. And coming \n",
      "among them the Numenoreans taught them many things. \n",
      "Corn and wine they brought, and they instructed Men in the \n",
      "sowing of seed and the grinding of grain, in the hewing of \n",
      "wood and the shaping of stone, and in the ordering of their \n",
      "life, such as it might be in the lands of swift death and little \n",
      "bliss. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Men of Middle-earth were comforted, and \n",
      "here and there upon the western shores the houseless \n",
      "woods drew back, and Men shook off the yoke of the \n",
      "offspring of Morgoth, and unlearned their terror of the dark. \n",
      "And they revered the memory of the tall Sea-kings, and \n",
      "when they had departed they called them gods, hoping for \n",
      "their return; for at that time the Numenoreans dwelt never \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "long in Middle-earth, nor made there as yet any habitation \n",
      "of their own. Eastward they must sail, but ever west their \n",
      "hearts returned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now this yearning grew ever greater with the years; \n",
      "and the Numenoreans began to hunger for the undying city \n",
      "that they saw from afar, and the desire of everlasting life, to \n",
      "escape from death and the ending of delight, grew strong \n",
      "upon them; and ever as their power and glory grew greater \n",
      "their unquiet increased. For though the Valar had rewarded \n",
      "the Dunedain with long life, they could not take from them \n",
      "the weariness of the world that comes at last, and they \n",
      "died, even their kings of the seed of Earendil; and the span \n",
      "of their lives was brief in the eyes of the Eldar. Thus it was \n",
      "that a shadow fell upon them: in which maybe the will of \n",
      "Morgoth was at work that still moved in the world. And the \n",
      "Numenoreans began to murmur, at first in their hearts, and \n",
      "then in open words, against the doom of Men, and most of \n",
      "all against the Ban which forbade them to sail into the \n",
      "West. \n",
      "\n",
      "And they said among themselves: 'Why do the Lords \n",
      "of the West sit there in peace unending, while we must die \n",
      "and go we know not whither, leaving our home and all that \n",
      "we have made? And the Eldar die not, even those that \n",
      "rebelled against the Lords. And since we have mastered all \n",
      "seas, and no water is so wild or so wide that our ships \n",
      "cannot overcome it, why should we not go to Avallone and \n",
      "greet there our friends?' \n",
      "\n",
      "And some there were who said: 'Why should we not go \n",

      "The Eldar reported these words to the Valar, and \n",
      "Manwe was grieved, seeing a cloud gather on the noontide \n",
      "of Numenor. And he sent messengers to the Dunedain, \n",

      "\n",
      "'The Doom of the World,' they said, 'One alone can \n",
      "change who made it. And were you so to voyage that \n",

      "To which they answered: 'You know that he has a fate \n",
      "apart, and was adjudged to the Firstborn who die not; yet \n",
      "this also is his doom that he can never return again to \n",
      "mortal lands. Whereas you and your people are not of the \n",
      "Firstborn, but are mortal Men as lluvatar made you. Yet it \n",
      "seems that you desire now to have the good of both \n",
      "kindreds, to sail to Valinor when you will, and to return when \n",
      "you please to your homes. That cannot be. Nor can the \n",
      "Valar take away the gifts of lluvatar. The Eldar, you say, are \n",
      "unpunished, and even those who rebelled do not die. Yet \n",
      "that is to them neither reward nor punishment, but the \n",
      "fulfilment of their being. They cannot escape, and are \n",
      "bound to this world, never to leave it so long as it lasts, for \n",
      "its life is theirs. And you are punished for the rebellion of \n",
      "Men, you say, in which you had small part, and so it is that \n",
      "you die. But that was not at first appointed for a \n",
      "punishment. Thus you escape, and leave the world, and are \n",
      "not bound to it, in hope or in weariness. Which of us \n",
      "therefore should envy the others?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "And the Numenoreans answered: 'Why should we not \n",
      "envy the Valar, or even the least of the Deathless? For of us \n",
      "is required a blind trust, and a hope without assurance, \n",
      "knowing not what lies before us in a little while. And yet we \n",
      "also love the Earth and would not lose it.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Messengers said: 'Indeed the mind of lluvatar \n",

      "revealed all things that are to come. But this we hold to be \n",
      "true, that your home is not here, neither in the Land of Aman \n",
      "nor anywhere within the Circles of the World. And the Doom \n",
      "of Men, that they should depart, was at first a gift of lluvatar. \n",
      "It became a grief to them only because coming under the \n",

      "surrounded by a great darkness, of which they were afraid; \n",
      "and some grew wilful and proud and would not yield, until \n",
      "life was reft from them. We who bear the ever-mounting \n",
      "burden of the years do not clearly understand this; but if that \n",
      "grief has returned to trouble you, as you say, then we fear \n",
      "that the Shadow arises once more and grows again in your \n",

      "Men, who escaped from the Shadow of old and fought \n",
      "valiantly against it, we say to you: Beware! The will of Eru \n",

      "withhold the trust to which you are called, lest soon it \n",
      "become again a bond by which you are constrained. Hope \n",
      "rather that in the end even the least of your desires shall \n",
      "have fruit. The love of Arda was set in your hearts by \n",
      "lluvatar, and he does not plant to no purpose. Nonetheless, \n",
      "many ages of Men unborn may pass ere that purpose is \n",
      "made known; and to you it will be revealed and not to the \n",
      "Valar.' \n",

      "These things took place in the days of Tar-Ciryatan the \n",

      "proud men, eager for wealth, and they laid the men of \n",
      "Middle-earth under tribute, taking now rather than giving. It \n",
      "was to Tar-Atanamir that the Messengers came; and he \n",
      "was the thirteenth King, and in his day the Realm of \n",
      "Numenor had endured for more than two thousand years, \n",
      "and was come to the zenith of its bliss, if not yet of its \n",
      "power. ButAtanamir was ill pleased with the counsel of the \n",
      "Messengers and gave little heed to it, and the greater part \n",
      "of his people followed him; for they wished still to escape \n",
      "death in their own day, not waiting upon hope. And \n",
      "Atanamir lived to a great age, clinging to his life beyond the \n",
      "end of all joy; and he was the first of the Numenoreans to do \n",
      "this, refusing to depart until he was witless and unmanned, \n",
      "and denying to his son the kingship at the height of his \n",
      "days. For the Lords of Numenor had been wont to wed late \n",
      "in their long lives and to depart and leave the mastery to \n",
      "their sons when these were come to full stature of body and \n",
      "mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Tar-Ancalimon, son of Atanamir, became King, \n",
      "and he was of like mind; and in his day the people of \n",
      "Numenor became divided. On the one hand was the \n",
      "greater party, and they were called the King's Men, and \n",
      "they grew proud and were estranged from the Eldar and the \n",
      "Valar. And on the other hand was the lesser party, and they \n",
      "were called the Elendili, the Elf-friends; for though they \n",
      "remained loyal indeed to the King and the House of Elros, \n",
      "they wished to keep the friendship of the Eldar, and they \n",
      "hearkened to the counsel of the Lords of the West. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless even they, who named themselves the Faithful, \n",
      "did not wholly escape from the affliction of their people, and \n",
      "they were troubled by the thought of death. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the bliss of Westernesse became diminished; \n",
      "but still its might and splendour increased. For the kings \n",
      "and their people had not yet abandoned wisdom, and if \n",
      "they loved the Valar no longer at least they still feared them. \n",
      "They did not dare openly to break the Ban or to sail beyond \n",
      "the limits that had been appointed. Eastwards still they \n",
      "steered their tall ships. But the fear of death grew ever \n",
      "darker upon them, and they delayed it by all means that \n",
      "they could; and they began to build great houses for their \n",
      "dead, while their wise men laboured unceasingly to \n",
      "discover if they might the secret of recalling life, or at the \n",
      "least of the prolonging of Men's days. Yet they achieved \n",
      "only the art of preserving incorrupt the dead flesh of Men, \n",
      "and they filled all the land with silent tombs in which the \n",
      "thought of death was enshrined in the darkness. But those \n",
      "that lived turned the more eagerly to pleasure and revelry, \n",
      "desiring ever more goods and more riches; and after the \n",
      "days of Tar-Ancalimon the offering of the first fruits to Eru \n",
      "was neglected, and men went seldom any more to the \n",
      "Hallow upon the heights of Meneltarma in the midst of the \n",
      "land. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it came to pass in that time that the \n",
      "Numenoreans first made great settlements upon the west \n",
      "shores of the ancient lands; for their own land seemed to \n",
      "them shrunken, and they had no rest or content therein, and \n",
      "they desired now wealth and dominion in Middle-earth, \n",
      "since the West was denied. Great harbours and strong \n",
      "towers they made, and there many of them took up their \n",
      "abode; but they appeared now rather as lords and masters \n",
      "and gatherers of tribute than as helpers and teachers. And \n",
      "the great ships of the Numenoreans were borne east on the \n",
      "winds and returned ever laden, and the power and majesty \n",
      "of their kings were increased; and they drank and they \n",
      "feasted and they clad themselves in silver and gold. \n",
      "\n",
      "In all this the Elf-friends had small part They alone \n",
      "came now ever to the north and the land of Gil-galad, \n",
      "keeping their friendship with the Elves and lending them aid \n",
      "against Sauron; and their haven was Pelargir above the \n",
      "mouths of Anduin the Great. But the King's Men sailed far \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "away to the south; and the lordships and strongholds that \n",
      "they made have left many rumours in the legends of Men. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this Age, as is elsewhere told, Sauron arose again \n",
      "in Middle-earth, and grew, and turned back to the evil in \n",
      "which he was nurtured by Morgoth, becoming mighty in his \n",
      "service. Already in the days of Tar-Minastir, the eleventh \n",
      "King of Numenor, he had fortified the land of Mordor and \n",
      "had built there the Tower of Barad-dur, and thereafter he \n",
      "strove ever for the dominion of Middle-earth, to become a \n",
      "king over all kings and as a god unto Men. And Sauron \n",
      "hated the Numenoreans, because of the deeds of their \n",
      "fathers and their ancient alliance with the Elves and \n",
      "allegiance to the Valar; nor did he forget the aid that Tar- \n",
      "Minastir had rendered to Gil-galad of old, in that time when \n",
      "the One Ring was forged and there was war between \n",
      "Sauron and the Elves in Eriador. Now he learned that the \n",
      "kings of Numenor had increased in power and splendour, \n",
      "and he hated them the more; and he feared them, lest they \n",
      "should invade his lands and wrest from him the dominion of \n",
      "the East. But for a long time he did not dare to challenge \n",
      "the Lords of the Sea, and he withdrew from the coasts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Sauron was ever guileful, and it is said that among \n",
      "those whom he ensnared with the Nine Rings three were \n",
      "great lords of Numenorean race. And when the Ulairi arose \n",
      "that were the Ring-wraiths, his servants, and the strength of \n",
      "his terror and mastery over Men had grown exceedingly \n",
      "great, he began to assail the strong places of the \n",
      "Numenoreans upon the shores of the sea. \n",
      "\n",
      "In those days the Shadow grew deeper upon \n",
      "Numenor; and the lives of the Kings of the House of Elros \n",
      "waned because of their rebellion, but they hardened their \n",
      "hearts the more against the Valar. And the nineteenth king \n",
      "took the sceptre of his fathers, and he ascended the throne \n",
      "in the name of Adunakhor, Lord of the West, forsaking the \n",
      "Elven-tongues and forbidding their use in his hearing. Yet hi \n",
      "the Scroll of Kings the name Herunumen was inscribed in \n",
      "the High-elven speech, because of ancient custom, which \n",
      "the kings feared to break utterly, lest evil befall Now this title \n",
      "seemed to the Faithful over-proud, being the title of the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "appointed Powers. But worse was yet to come. For Ar- \n",
      "Gimilzor the twenty-second king was the greatest enemy of \n",
      "the Faithful. In his day the White Tree was untended and \n",
      "began to decline; and he forbade utterly the use of the \n",
      "Elven-tongues, and punished those that welcomed the \n",
      "ships of Eressea, that still came secretly to the west-shores \n",
      "of the land. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Elendili dwelt mostly in the western regions of \n",

      "dwell in the east of the land; and there they were watched. \n",
      "And the chief dwelling of the Faithful in the later days was \n",
      "thus nigh to the harbour of Romenna; thence many set sail \n",
      "to Middle-earth, seeking the northern coasts where they \n",
      "might speak still with the Eldar in the kingdom of Gil-galad. \n",
      "This was known to the kings, but they hindered it not, so \n",
      "long as the Elendili departed from their land and did not \n",
      "return; for they desired to end all friendship between then: \n",

      "Spies of the Valar, hoping to keep their deeds and their \n",
      "counsels hidden from the Lords of the West. But all that \n",
      "they did was known to Manwe, and the Valar were wroth \n",
      "with the Kings of Numenor, and gave them counsel and \n",
      "protection no more; and the ships of Eressea came never \n",
      "again out of the sunset, and the havens of Andunie were \n",
      "forlorn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Highest in honour after the house of the kings were the \n",
      "Lords of Andunie; for they were of the line of Elros, being \n",
      "descended from Silmarien, daughter of Tar-Elendil the \n",
      "fourth king of Numenor. And these lords were loyal to the \n",
      "kings, and revered them; and the Lord of Andunie was ever \n",
      "among the chief councillors of the Sceptre. Yet also from \n",
      "the beginning they bore especial love to the Eldar and \n",
      "reverence for the Valar; and as the Shadow grew they \n",
      "aided the Faithful as they could. But for long they did not \n",
      "declare themselves openly, and sought rather to amend the \n",
      "hearts of the lords of the Sceptre with wiser counsels. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a lady Inzilbeth, renowned for her beauty, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "mother; but the kings and their sons were grown proud and \n",
      "not to be gainsaid in their wishes. No love was there \n",
      "between Ar-Gi mi Izor and his queen, or between their sons. \n",
      "Inziladun, the elder, was like his mother in mind as in body; \n",

      "But when Inziladun acceded to the sceptre, he took \n",
      "again a title in the Elven-tongue as of old, calling himself \n",
      "Tar-Palantir, for he was far-sighted both in eye and in mind, \n",
      "and even those that hated him feared his words as those of \n",
      "a true-seer. He gave peace for a while to the Faithful; and \n",
      "he went once more at due seasons to the Hallow of Eru \n",
      "upon the Meneltarma, which Ar-Gi mi Izor had forsaken. The \n",

      "would the line of the Kings come to its end. But his \n",
      "repentance was too late to appease the anger of the Valar \n",
      "with the insolence of his fathers, of which the greater part of \n",
      "his people did not repent. And Gimilkhad was strong and \n",
      "ungentle, and he took the leadership of those that had been \n",
      "called the King's Men and opposed the will of his brother as \n",
      "openly as he dared, and yet more in secret. Thus the days \n",
      "of Tar-Palantir became darkened with grief; and he would \n",
      "spend much of his time in the west, and there ascended \n",
      "often the ancient tower of King Minastir upon the hill of \n",
      "Oromet nigh to Andunie, whence he gazed westward in \n",
      "yearning, hoping to see, maybe, some sail upon the sea. \n",

      "one of Elros' line even in its waning), but this brought no \n",
      "peace to the King. For Pharazon son of Gimilkhad had \n",
      "become a man yet more restless and eager for wealth and \n",
      "power than his father. He had fared often abroad, as a \n",
      "leader in the wars that the Numenoreans made then in the \n",
      "coastlands of Middle-earth, seeking to extend their \n",
      "dominion over Men; and thus he had won great renown as \n",
      "a captain both by land and by sea. Therefore when he \n",
      "came back to Numenor, hearing of his father's death, the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hearts of the people were turned to him; for he brought with \n",
      "him great wealth, and was for the time free in his giving. \n",
      "\n",
      "And it came to pass that Tar-Palantir grew weary of \n",
      "grief and died. He had no son, but a daughter only, whom \n",
      "he named Miriel in the Elven-tongue; and to her now by right \n",
      "and the laws of the Numenoreans came the sceptre. But \n",
      "Pharazon took her to wife against her will, doing evil in this \n",
      "and evil also in that the laws of Numenor did not permit the \n",
      "marriage, even in the royal house, of those more nearly \n",
      "akin than cousins in the second degree. And when they \n",
      "were wedded, he seized the sceptre into his own hand, \n",
      "taking the title of Ar-Pharazon (Tar-Calion in the Elven- \n",
      "tongue); and the name of his queen he changed to Ar- \n",
      "Zimraphel. \n",
      "\n",
      "The mightiest and proudest was Ar-Pharazon the \n",
      "Golden of all those that had wielded the Sceptre of the \n",
      "Sea-Kings since the foundation of Numenor; and three and \n",
      "twenty Kings and Queens had ruled the Numenoreans \n",
      "before, and slept now in their deep tombs under the mount \n",
      "of Meneltarma, lying upon beds of gold. \n",
      "\n",
      "And sitting upon his carven throne in the city of \n",
      "Armenelos in the glory of his power, he brooded darkly, \n",
      "thinking of war. For he had learned in Middle-earth of the \n",
      "strength of the realm of Sauron, and of his hatred of \n",
      "Westernesse. And now there came to him the masters of \n",
      "ships and captains returning out of the East, and they \n",
      "reported that Sauron was putting forth his might, since Ar- \n",
      "Pharazon had gone back from Middle-earth, and he was \n",
      "pressing down upon the cities by the coasts; and he had \n",
      "taken now the title of King of Men, and declared his \n",
      "purpose to drive the Numenoreans into the sea, and \n",
      "destroy even Numenor, if that might be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great was the anger of Ar-Pharazon at these tidings, \n",
      "and as he pondered long in secret, his heart was filled with \n",
      "the desire of power unbounded and the sole dominion of \n",
      "his will. And he determined without counsel of the Valar, or \n",
      "the aid of any wisdom but his own, that the title of King of \n",
      "Men he would himself claim, and would compel Sauron to \n",
      "become his vassal and his servant; for in his pride he \n",
      "deemed that no king should ever arise so mighty as to vie \n",
      "with the Heir of Earendil. Therefore he began in that time to \n",
      "smithy great hoard of weapons, and many ships of war he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "built and stored them with his arms; and when all was made \n",
      "ready he himself set sail with his host into the East. \n",
      "\n",
      "And men saw his sails coming up out of the sunset, \n",
      "dyed as with scarlet and gleaming with red and gold, and \n",
      "fear fell upon the dwellers by the coasts, and they fled far \n",
      "away. But the fleet came at last to that place that was called \n",
      "Umbar, where was the mighty haven of the Numenoreans \n",
      "that no hand had wrought. Empty and silent were all the \n",
      "lands about when the King of the Sea marched upon \n",
      "Middle-earth. For seven days he journeyed with banner and \n",
      "trumpet, and he came to a hill, and he went up, and he set \n",
      "there his pavilion and his throne; and he sat him down in the \n",
      "midst of the land, and the tents of his host were ranged all \n",
      "about him, blue, golden, and white, as a field of tall flowers. \n",
      "Then he sent forth heralds, and he commanded Sauron to \n",
      "come before him and swear to him fealty. \n",
      "\n",
      "And Sauron came. Even from his mighty tower of \n",
      "Barad-dur he came, and made no offer of battle. For he \n",
      "perceived that the power and majesty of the Kings of the \n",
      "Sea surpassed all rumour of them, so that he could not trust \n",
      "even the greatest of his servants to withstand them; and he \n",
      "saw not his time yet to work his will with the Dunedain. And \n",
      "he was crafty, well skilled to gain what he would by subtlety \n",
      "when force might not avail. Therefore he humbled himself \n",
      "before Ar-Pharazon and smoothed his tongue; and men \n",
      "wondered, for all that he said seemed fair and wise. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Ar-Pharazon was not yet deceived, and it came \n",
      "into his mind that, for the better keeping of Sauron and of \n",
      "his oaths of fealty, he should be brought to Numenor, there \n",
      "to dwell as a hostage for himself and all his servants in \n",
      "Middle-earth. To this Sauron assented as one constrained, \n",
      "yet in his secret thought he received it gladly, for it chimed \n",
      "indeed with his desire. And Sauron passed over the sea \n",
      "and looked upon the land of Numenor, and on the city of \n",
      "Armenelos in the days of its glory, and he was astounded; \n",
      "but his heart within was filled the more with envy and hate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet such was the cunning of his mind and mouth, and \n",
      "the strength of his hidden will, that ere three years had \n",
      "passed he had become closest to the secret counsels of \n",
      "the King; for flattery sweet as honey was ever on his \n",
      "tongue, and knowledge he had of many things yet \n",
      "unrevealed to Men. And seeing the favour that he had of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "their lord all the councillors began to fawn upon him, save \n",
      "one alone, Amandil lord of Andunie. Then slowly a change \n",
      "came over the land, and the hearts of the Elf-friends were \n",
      "sorely troubled, and many fell away out of fear; and although \n",
      "those that remained still called themselves the Faithful, their \n",
      "enemies named them rebels. For now, having the ears of \n",
      "men, Sauron with many arguments gainsaid all that the \n",
      "Valar had taught; and he bade men think that in the world, \n",
      "in the east and even hi the west, there lay yet many seas \n",
      "and many lands for their winning, wherein was wealth \n",
      "uncounted. And still, if they should at the last come to the \n",
      "end of those lands and seas, beyond all lay the Ancient \n",
      "Darkness. 'And out of it the world was made. For Darkness \n",
      "alone is worshipful, and the Lord thereof may yet make \n",
      "other worlds to be gifts to those that serve him, so that the \n",
      "increase of their power shall find no end.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Ar-Pharazon said: 'Who is the Lord of the \n",
      "Darkness?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then behind locked doors Sauron spoke to the King, \n",
      "and he lied, saying: 'It is he whose name is not now spoken; \n",
      "for the Valar have deceived you concerning him, putting \n",
      "forward the name of Eru, a phantom devised in the folly of \n",
      "their hearts, seeking to enchain Men in servitude to \n",
      "themselves. For they are the oracle of this Eru, which \n",
      "speaks only what they will. But he that is their master shall \n",
      "yet prevail, and he will deliver you from this phantom; and \n",
      "his name is Melkor, Lord of All, Giver of Freedom, and he \n",
      "shall make you stronger than they.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ar-Pharazon the King turned back to the worship \n",
      "of the Dark, and of Melkor the Lord thereof, at first in secret, \n",
      "but ere long openly and in the face of his people; and they \n",
      "for the most part followed him. Yet there dwelt still a \n",
      "remnant of the Faithful, as has been told, at Romenna and \n",
      "in the country near, and other few there were here and there \n",
      "in the land. The chief among them, to whom they looked for \n",
      "leading and courage in evil days, was Amandil, councillor \n",
      "of the King, and his son Elendil, whose sons were Isildur \n",
      "and Anarion, then young men by the reckoning of Numenor. \n",
      "Amandil and Elendil were great ship-captains; and they \n",
      "were of the line of Elros Tar-Minyatur, though not of the \n",
      "ruling house to whom belonged the crown and the throne in \n",
      "the city of Armenelos. In the days of their youth together \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amandil had been dear to Pharazon, and though he was of \n",
      "the Elf-friends he remained in his council until the coming of \n",
      "Sauron. Now he was dismissed, for Sauron hated him \n",
      "above all others in Numenor. But he was so noble, and had \n",
      "been so mighty a captain of the sea, that he was still held in \n",
      "honour by many of the people, and neither the King nor \n",
      "Sauron dared to lay hands on him as yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Amandil withdrew to Romenna, and all that \n",
      "he trusted still to be faithful he summoned to come thither in \n",
      "secret; for he feared that evil would now grow apace, and \n",
      "all the Elf-friends were in peril. And so it soon came to \n",
      "pass. For the Meneltarma was utterly deserted in those \n",
      "days; and though not even Sauron dared to defile the high \n",
      "place, yet the King would let no man, upon pain of death, \n",
      "ascend to it, not even those of the Faithful who kept lluvatar \n",
      "in their hearts. And Sauron urged the King to cut down the \n",
      "White Tree, Nimloth the Fair, that grew in his courts, for it \n",
      "was a memorial of the Eldar and of the light of Valinor. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the first the King would not assent to this, since be \n",
      "believed that the fortunes of his house were bound up with \n",
      "the Tree, as was forespoken by Tar-Palantir. Thus in his \n",
      "folly he who now hated the Eldar and the Valar vainly clung \n",
      "to the shadow of the old allegiance of Numenor. But when \n",
      "Amandil heard rumour of the evil purpose of Sauron he was \n",
      "grieved to the heart, knowing that in the end Sauron would \n",
      "surely have his will. Then he spoke to Elendil and the sons \n",
      "of Elendil, recalling the tale of the Trees of Valinor; and \n",
      "Isildur said no word, but went out by night and did a deed \n",
      "for which he was afterwards renowned. For he passed \n",
      "alone in disguise to Armenelos and to the courts of the \n",
      "King, which were now forbidden to the Faithful; and he \n",
      "came to the place of the Tree, which was forbidden to all by \n",
      "the orders of Sauron, and the Tree was watched day and \n",
      "night by guards in his service. At that time Nimloth was dark \n",
      "and bore no bloom, for it was late in the autumn, and its \n",
      "winter was nigh; and Isildur passed through the guards and \n",
      "took from the Tree a fruit that hung upon it, and turned to go. \n",
      "But the guard was aroused, and he was assailed, and \n",
      "fought his way out, receiving many wounds; and he \n",
      "escaped, and because he was disguised it was not \n",
      "discovered who had laid hands on the Tree. But Isildur \n",
      "came at last hardly back to Romenna and delivered the fruit \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to the hands of Amandil, ere his strength failed him. Then \n",
      "the fruit was planted in secret, and it was blessed by \n",
      "Amandil; and a shoot arose from it and sprouted in the \n",
      "spring. But when its first leaf opened then Isildur, who had \n",
      "lain long and come near to death, arose and was troubled \n",
      "no more by his wounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "None too soon was this done; for after the assault the \n",
      "King yielded to Sauron and felled the White Tree, and \n",
      "turned then wholly away from the allegiance of his fathers. \n",
      "But Sauron caused to be built upon the hill in the midst of \n",
      "the city of the Numenoreans, Armenelos the Golden, a \n",
      "mighty temple; and it was in the form of a circle at the base, \n",
      "and there the walls were fifty feet in thickness, and the width \n",
      "of the base was five hundred feet across the centre, and \n",
      "the walls rose from the ground five hundred feet, and they \n",
      "were crowned with a mighty dome. And that dome was \n",
      "roofed all with silver, and rose glittering in the sun, so that \n",
      "the light of it could be seen afar off; but soon the light was \n",
      "darkened, and the silver became black. For there was an \n",
      "altar of fire in the midst of the temple, and in the topmost of \n",
      "the dome there was a louver, whence there issued a great \n",
      "smoke. And the first fire upon the altar Sauron kindled with \n",
      "the hewn wood of Nimloth, and it crackled and was \n",
      "consumed; but men marvelled at the reek that went up from \n",
      "it, so that the land lay under a cloud for seven days, until \n",
      "slowly it passed into the west. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter the fire and smoke went up without ceasing; \n",
      "for the power of Sauron daily increased, and in that temple, \n",
      "with spilling of blood and torment and great wickedness, \n",
      "men made sacrifice to Melkor that he should release them \n",
      "from Death. And most often from among the Faithful they \n",
      "chose their victims; yet never openly on the charge that they \n",
      "would not worship Melkor, the Giver of Freedom, rather \n",
      "was cause sought against them that they hated the King \n",
      "and were his rebels, or that they plotted against their kin, \n",
      "devising lies and poisons. These charges were for the \n",
      "most part false; yet those were bitter days, and hate brings \n",
      "forth hate. \n",
      "\n",
      "But for all this Death did not depart from the land, \n",
      "rather it came sooner and more often, and in many dreadful \n",
      "guises. For whereas aforetime men had grown slowly old, \n",
      "and had laid them down in the end to sleep, when they were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "weary at last of the world, now madness and sickness \n",
      "assailed them; and yet they were afraid to die and go out \n",
      "into the dark, the realm of the lord that they had taken; and \n",
      "they cursed themselves in their agony. And men took \n",
      "weapons in those days and slew one another for little \n",
      "cause; for they were become quick to anger, and Sauron, \n",
      "or those whom he had bound to himself, went about the \n",
      "land setting man against man, so that the people murmured \n",
      "against the King and the lords, or against any that had \n",
      "aught that they had not; and the men of power took cruel \n",
      "revenge. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless for long it seemed to the Numenoreans \n",
      "that they prospered, and if they were not increased in \n",
      "happiness, yet they grew more strong, and their rich men \n",
      "ever richer. For with the aid and counsel of Sauron they \n",
      "multiplied then: possessions, and they devised engines, \n",
      "and they built ever greater ships. And they sailed now with \n",
      "power and armoury to Middle-earth, and they came no \n",
      "longer as bringers of gifts, nor even as rulers, but as fierce \n",
      "men of war. And they hunted the men of Middle-earth and \n",
      "took their goods and enslaved them, and many they slew \n",
      "cruelly upon their altars. For they built in their fortresses \n",
      "temples and great tombs in those days; and men feared \n",
      "them, and the memory of the kindly kings of the ancient \n",
      "days faded from the world and was darkened by many a \n",
      "tale of dread. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Ar-Pharazon, King of the Land of the Star, grew \n",
      "to the mightiest tyrant that had yet been in the world since \n",
      "the reign of Morgoth, though in truth Sauron ruled all from \n",
      "behind the throne. But the years passed, and the King felt \n",
      "the shadow of death approach, as his days lengthened; \n",
      "and he was filled with fear and wrath. Now came the hour \n",
      "that Sauron had prepared and long had awaited. And \n",
      "Sauron spoke to the King, saying that his strength was now \n",
      "so great that he might think to have his will in all things, and \n",
      "be subject to no command or ban. \n",
      "\n",
      "And he said: The Valar have possessed themselves \n",
      "of the land where there is no death; and they lie to you \n",
      "concerning it, hiding it as best they may, because of their \n",
      "avarice, and their fear lest the Kings of Men should wrest \n",
      "from them the deathless realm and rule the world in their \n",
      "stead. And though, doubtless, the gift of life unending is not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "for all, but only for such as are worthy, being men of might \n",
      "and pride and great lineage, yet against all Justice is it \n",
      "done that this gift, which is his due, should be withheld from \n",
      "the King of Bangs, Ar-Pharazon, mightiest of the sons of \n",
      "Earth, to whom Manwe alone can be compared, if even he. \n",
      "But great kings do not brook denials, and take what is their \n",
      "due.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ar-Pharazon, being besotted, and walking under \n",
      "the shadow of death, for his span was drawing towards its \n",
      "end, hearkened to Sauron; and he began to ponder in his \n",
      "heart how he might make war upon the Valar. He was long \n",
      "preparing this design, and he spoke not openly of it, yet it \n",
      "could not be hidden from all. And Amandil, becoming \n",
      "aware of the purposes of the King, was dismayed and filled \n",
      "with a great dread, for he knew that Men could not vanquish \n",
      "the Valar in war, and that ruin must come upon the world, if \n",
      "this war were not stayed. Therefore he called his son, \n",
      "Elendil, and he said to him: \n",
      "\n",
      "The days are dark, and there is no hope for Men, for \n",
      "the Faithful are few. Therefore I am minded to try that \n",
      "counsel which our forefather Earendil took of old, to sail into \n",
      "the West, be there ban or no, and to speak to the Valar, \n",
      "even to Manwe himself, if may be, and beseech his aid ere \n",
      "all is lost.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you then betray the King?' said Elendil. 'For you \n",
      "know well the charge that they make against us, that we are \n",
      "traitors and spies, and that until this day it has been false.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'If I thought that Manwe needed such a messenger,' \n",
      "said Amandil, I would betray the King. For there is but one \n",
      "loyalty from which no man can be absolved in heart for any \n",
      "cause. But it is for mercy upon Men and their deliverance \n",
      "from Sauron the Deceiver that I would plead, since some at \n",
      "least have remained faithful. And as for the Ban, I will suffer \n",
      "in myself the penalty, lest all my people should become \n",
      "guilty.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'But what think you, my father, is like to befall those of \n",
      "your house whom you leave behind, when your deed \n",
      "becomes known?' \n",
      "\n",
      "'It must not become known,' said Amandil. 'I will \n",
      "prepare my going in secret, and I will set sail into the east, \n",
      "whither daily the ships depart from our havens; and \n",
      "thereafter, as wind and chance may allow, I will go about, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "through south or north, back into the west, and seek what I \n",
      "may find. But for you and your folk, my son, I counsel that \n",
      "you should prepare yourselves other ships, and put aboard \n",
      "all such things as your hearts cannot bear to part with; and \n",
      "when the ships are ready, you should lie in the haven of \n",
      "Romenna, and give out among men that you purpose, when \n",
      "you see your time, to follow me into the east. Amandil is no \n",
      "longer so dear to our kinsman upon the throne that he will \n",
      "grieve over much, if we seek to depart, for a season or for \n",
      "good. But let it not be seen that you intend to take many \n",
      "men, or he will be troubled, because of the war that he now \n",
      "plots, for which he will need all the force that he may gather. \n",
      "Seek out the Faithful that are known still to be true, and let \n",
      "them join you in secret, if they are willing to go with you, and \n",
      "share in your design.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'And what shall that design be?' said Elendil. \n",
      "\n",
      "'To meddle not in the war, and to watch,' answered \n",
      "Amandil. 'Until I return I can say no more. But it is most like \n",
      "that you shall fly from the Land of the Star with no star to \n",
      "guide you; for that land is defiled. Then you shall lose all that \n",
      "you have loved, foretasting death in life, seeking a land of \n",
      "exile elsewhere. But east or west the Valar alone can say.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Amandil said farewell to all his household, as one \n",
      "that is about to die. 'For,' said he, 'it may well prove that you \n",
      "will see me never again; and that I shall show you no such \n",
      "sign as Earendil showed long ago. But hold you ever in \n",
      "readiness, for the end of the world that we have known is \n",
      "now at hand.' \n",
      "\n",
      "It is said that Amandil set sail in a small ship at night, \n",
      "and steered first eastward, and then went about and \n",
      "passed into the west. And he took with him three servants, \n",
      "dear to his heart, and never again were they heard of by \n",
      "word or sign in this world, nor is there any tale or guess of \n",
      "their fate. Men could not a second time be saved by any \n",
      "such embassy, and for the treason of Numenor there was \n",
      "no easy absolving. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Elendil did all that his father had bidden, and his \n",
      "ships lay off the east coast of the land; and the Faithful put \n",
      "aboard their wives and their children, and their heirlooms, \n",
      "and great store of goods. Many things there were of beauty \n",
      "and power, such as the Numenoreans had contrived in the \n",
      "days of their wisdom, vessels and jewels, and scrolls of lore \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "written in scarlet and black. And Seven Stones they had, \n",
      "the gift of the Eldar; but in the ship of Isildur was guarded \n",
      "the young tree, the scion of Nimloth the Fair. Thus Elendil \n",
      "held himself in readiness, and did not meddle in the evil \n",
      "deeds of those days; and ever he looked for a sign that did \n",
      "not come. Then he journeyed in secret to the western \n",
      "shores and gazed out over the sea, for sorrow and yearning \n",
      "were upon him, and he greatly loved his father. But naught \n",
      "could he descry save the fleets of Ar-Pharazon gathering in \n",
      "the havens of the west. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now aforetime in the isle of Numenor the weather was \n",
      "ever apt to the needs and liking of Men: rain in due season \n",
      "and ever in measure; and sunshine, now warmer, now \n",
      "cooler, and winds from the sea. And when the wind was in \n",
      "the west, it seemed to many that it was filled with a \n",
      "fragrance, fleeting but sweet, heart-stirring, as of flowers \n",
      "that bloom for ever in undying meads and have no names \n",
      "on mortal shores. But all this was now changed; for the sky \n",
      "itself was darkened, and there were storms of rain and hail \n",
      "in those days, and violent winds; and ever and anon a great \n",
      "ship of the Numenoreans would founder and return not to \n",
      "haven, though such a grief had not till then befallen them \n",
      "since the rising of the Star. And out of the west there would \n",
      "come at times a great cloud in the evening, shaped as it \n",
      "were an eagle, with pinions spread to the north and the \n",
      "south; and slowly it would loom up, blotting out the sunset, \n",
      "and then uttermost night would fall upon Numenor. And \n",
      "some of the eagles bore lightning beneath their wings, and \n",
      "thunder echoed between sea and cloud. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then men grew afraid. 'Behold the Eagles of the Lords \n",
      "of the West!' they cried. 'The Eagles of Manwe are come \n",
      "upon Numenor!' And they fell upon their faces. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then some few would repent for a season, but others \n",
      "hardened their hearts, and they shook their fists at heaven, \n",
      "saying: 'The Lords of the West have plotted against us. \n",
      "They strike first. The next blow shall be ours!' These words \n",
      "the King himself spoke, but they were devised bySauron. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the lightnings increased and slew men upon the \n",
      "hills, and in the fields, and in the streets of the city; and a \n",
      "fiery bolt smote the dome of the Temple and shore it \n",
      "asunder, and it was wreathed in flame. But the Temple itself \n",
      "was unshaken, and Sauron stood there upon the pinnacle \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and defied the lightning and was unharmed; and in that hour \n",
      "men called him a god and did all that he would. When \n",
      "therefore the last portent came they heeded it little. For the \n",
      "land shook under them, and a groaning as of thunder \n",
      "underground was mingled with the roaring of the sea, and \n",
      "smoke issued from the peak of the Meneltarma. But all the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In that time the fleets of the Numenoreans darkened \n",
      "the sea upon the west of the land, and they were like an \n",
      "archipelago of a thousand isles; their masts were as a \n",
      "forest upon the mountains, and their sails like a brooding \n",
      "cloud; and their banners were golden and black. And all \n",
      "things waited upon the word of Ar-Pharazon; and Sauron \n",
      "withdrew into the inmost circle of the Temple, and men \n",
      "brought him victims to be burned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Eagles of the Lords of the West came up out \n",
      "of the dayfall, and they were arrayed as for battle, \n",
      "advancing in a line the end of which diminished beyond \n",
      "sight; and as they came their wings spread ever wider, \n",
      "grasping the sky. But the West burned red behind them, \n",
      "and they glowed beneath, as though they were lit with a \n",
      "flame of great anger, so that all Numenor was illumined as \n",
      "with a smouldering fire; and men looked upon the faces of \n",
      "their fellows, and it seemed to them that they were red with \n",
      "wrath. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ar-Pharazon hardened his heart, and he went \n",
      "aboard his mighty ship, Alcarondas, Castle of the Sea. \n",
      "Many-oared it was and many-masted, golden and sable; \n",
      "and upon it the throne of Ar-Pharazon was set. Then he did \n",
      "on his panoply and his crown, and let raise his standard, \n",
      "and he gave the signal for the raising of the anchors; and in \n",
      "that hour the trumpets of Numenor outrang the thunder. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the fleets of the Numenoreans moved against the \n",
      "menace of the West; and there was little wind, but they had \n",
      "many oars and many strong slaves to row beneath the lash. \n",
      "The sun went down, and there came a great silence. \n",
      "Darkness fell upon the land, and the sea was still, while the \n",
      "world waited for what should betide. Slowly the fleets \n",
      "passed out of the sight of the watchers in the havens, and \n",
      "their lights faded, and night took them; and in the morning \n",
      "they were gone. For a wind arose in the east and it wafted \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "them away; and they broke the Ban of the Valar, and sailed \n",
      "into forbidden seas, going up with war against the \n",
      "Deathless, to wrest from them everlasting life within the \n",
      "Circles of the World. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the fleets of Ar-Pharazon came up out of the deeps \n",
      "of the sea and encompassed Avallone and all the isle of \n",
      "Eressea, and the Eldar mourned, for the light of the setting \n",
      "sun was cut off by the cloud of the Numenoreans. And at \n",
      "last Ar-Pharazon came even to Aman, the Blessed Realm, \n",
      "and the coasts of Valinor; and still all was silent, and doom \n",
      "hung by a thread. For Ar-Pharazon wavered at the end, and \n",
      "almost he turned back. His heart misgave him when he \n",
      "looked upon the soundless shores and saw Taniquetil \n",
      "shining, whiter than snow, colder than death, silent, \n",
      "immutable, terrible as the shadow of the light of lluvatar. But \n",
      "pride was now his master, and at last he left his ship and \n",
      "strode upon the shore, claiming the land for his own, if none \n",
      "should do battle for it. And a host of the Numenoreans \n",
      "encamped in might about Tuna, whence all the Eldar had \n",
      "fled. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Manwe upon the Mountain called upon lluvatar, \n",
      "and for that time the Valar laid down their government of \n",
      "Arda. But lluvatar showed forth his power, and he changed \n",
      "the fashion of the world; and a great chasm opened in the \n",
      "sea between Numenor and the Deathless Lands, and the \n",
      "waters flowed down into it, and the noise and smoke of the \n",
      "cataracts went up to heaven, and the world was shaken. \n",
      "And all the fleets of the Numenoreans were drawn down \n",
      "into the abyss, and they were drowned and swallowed up \n",
      "for ever. But Ar-Pharazon the King and the mortal warriors \n",
      "that had set foot upon the land of Aman were buried under \n",
      "falling hills: there it is said that they lie imprisoned in the \n",
      "Caves of the Forgotten, until the Last Battle and the Day of \n",
      "Doom. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the land of Aman and Eressea of the Eldar were \n",
      "taken away and removed beyond the reach of Men for ever. \n",
      "And Andor, the Land of Gift, Numenor of the Kings, Elenna \n",
      "of the Star of Earendil, was utterly destroyed. For it was \n",
      "nigh to the east of the great rift, and its foundations were \n",
      "overturned, and it fell and went down into darkness, and is \n",
      "no more. And there is not now upon Earth any place \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "abiding where the memory of a time without evil is \n",
      "preserved. For lluvatar cast back the Great Seas west of \n",
      "Middle-earth, and the Empty Lands east of it, and new \n",
      "lands and new seas were made; and the world was \n",
      "diminished, for Valinor and Eressea were taken from it into \n",
      "the realm of hidden things. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an hour unlocked for by Men this doom befell, on the \n",
      "nine and thirtieth day since the passing of the fleets. Then \n",
      "suddenly fire burst from the Meneltarma, and there came a \n",
      "mighty wind and a tumult of the earth, and the sky reeled, \n",
      "and the hills slid, and Numenor went down into the sea, with \n",
      "all its children and its wives and its maidens and its ladies \n",
      "proud; and all its gardens and its halls and its towers, its \n",
      "tombs and its riches, and its jewels and its webs and its \n",
      "things painted and carven, and its lore: they vanished for \n",
      "ever. And last of all the mounting wave, green and cold and \n",
      "plumed with foam, climbing over the land, took to its bosom \n",
      "Tar-Miriel the Queen, fairer than silver or ivory or pearls. \n",
      "Too late she strove to ascend the steep ways of the \n",
      "Meneltarma to the holy place; for the waters overtook her, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But whether or no it were that Amandil came indeed to \n",
      "Valinor and Manwe hearkened to his prayer, by grace of \n",
      "the Valar Elendil and his sons and their people were \n",
      "spared from the ruin of that day. For Elendil had remained \n",
      "in Romenna, refusing the summons of the King when he set \n",
      "forth to war; and avoiding the soldiers of Sauron that came \n",
      "to seize him and drag him to the fires of the Temple, he \n",
      "went aboard his ship and stood off from the shore, waiting \n",
      "on the time. There he was protected by the land from the \n",
      "great draught of the sea that drew all towards the abyss, \n",
      "and afterwards he was sheltered from the first fury of the \n",
      "storm. But when the devouring wave rolled over the land \n",
      "and Numenor toppled to its fall, then he would have been \n",
      "overwhelmed and would have deemed it the lesser grief to \n",
      "perish, for no wrench of death could be more bitter than the \n",
      "loss and agony of that day; but the great wind took him, \n",
      "wilder than any wind that Men had known, roaring from the \n",
      "west, and it swept his ships far away; and it rent their sails \n",
      "and snapped their masts, hunting the unhappy men like \n",
      "straws upon the water. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nine ships there were: four for Elendil, and for Isildur \n",
      "three, and for Anarion two; and they fled before the black \n",
      "gale out of the twilight of doom into the darkness of the \n",
      "world. And the deeps rose beneath them in towering anger, \n",
      "and waves like unto mountains moving with great caps of \n",
      "writhen snow bore them up amid the wreckage of the \n",
      "clouds, and after many days cast them away upon the \n",
      "shores of Middle-earth. And all the coasts and seaward \n",
      "regions of the western world suffered great change and ruin \n",
      "in that time; for the seas invaded the lands, and shores \n",
      "foundered, and ancient isles were drowned, and new isles \n",
      "were uplifted; and hills crumbled and rivers were turned into \n",
      "strange courses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Elendil and his sons after founded kingdoms in \n",
      "Middle-earth; and though their lore and craft was but an \n",
      "echo of that which had been ere Sauron came to Numenor, \n",
      "yet very great it seemed to the wild men of the world. And \n",
      "much is said in other lore of the deeds of the heirs of \n",
      "Elendil in the age that came after, and of their strife with \n",
      "Sauron that not yet was ended. \n",
      "\n",
      "For Sauron himself was filled with great fear at the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "wrath of the Valar, and the doom that Eru laid upon sea and \n",
      "land. It was greater far than aught he had looked for, hoping \n",
      "only for the death of the Numenoreans and the defeat of \n",
      "their proud king. And Sauron, sitting in his black seat in the \n",
      "midst of the Temple, had laughed when he heard the \n",
      "trumpets of Ar-Pharazon sounding for battle; and again he \n",
      "had laughed when he heard the thunder of the storm; and a \n",
      "third time, even as he laughed at his own thought, thinking \n",
      "what he would do now in the world, being rid of the Edain \n",
      "for ever, he was taken in the midst of his mirth, and his seat \n",
      "and his temple fell into the abyss. But Sauron was not of \n",
      "mortal flesh, and though he was robbed now of that shape \n",
      "in which he had wrought so great an evil, so that he could \n",
      "never again appear fair to the eyes of Men, yet his spirit \n",
      "arose out of the deep and passed as a shadow and a \n",
      "black wind over the sea, and came back to Middle-earth \n",
      "and to Mordor that was his home. There he took up again \n",
      "his great Ring in Barad-dur, and dwelt there, dark and \n",
      "silent, until he wrought himself a new guise, an image of \n",
      "malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the \n",
      "Terrible few could endure. \n",
      "\n",
      "But these things come not into the tale of the Drowning \n",
      "of Numenor, of which now all is told. And even the name of \n",
      "that land perished, and Men spoke thereafter not of Elenna, \n",
      "nor of Andor the Gift that was taken away, nor of Numenore \n",
      "on the confines of the world; but the exiles on the shores of \n",
      "the sea, if they turned towards the West in the desire of \n",
      "their hearts, spoke of Mar-nu-Falmar that was whelmed in \n",
      "the waves, Akallabeth the Downfallen, Atalante in the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the Exiles many believed that the summit of the \n",
      "Meneltarma, the Pillar of Heaven, was not drowned for \n",
      "ever, but rose again above the waves, a lonely island lost in \n",
      "the great waters; for it had been a hallowed place, and \n",
      "even in the days of Sauron none had defiled it And some \n",
      "there were of the seed of Earendil that afterwards sought \n",
      "for it, because it was said among loremasters that the far- \n",
      "sighted men of old could see from the Meneltarma a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "glimmer of the Deathless Land. For even after the ruin the \n",
      "hearts of the Dunedain were still set westwards; and though \n",
      "they knew indeed that the world was changed, they said: \n",
      "'Avallone is vanished from the Earth and the Land of Aman \n",
      "is taken away, and in the world of this present darkness \n",
      "they cannot be found. Yet once they were, and therefore \n",
      "they still are, in true being and in the whole shape of the \n",
      "world as at first it was devised.' \n",
      "\n",
      "For the Dunedain held that even mortal Men, if so \n",
      "blessed, might look upon other times than those of their \n",
      "bodies' life; and they longed ever to escape from the \n",
      "shadows of their exile and to see in some fashion fee light \n",
      "that dies not; for the sorrow of the thought of death had \n",
      "pursued them over the deeps of the sea. Thus it was that \n",
      "great mariners among them would still search the empty \n",
      "seas, hoping to come upon the Isle of Meneltarma, and \n",
      "there to see a vision of things that were. But they found it \n",
      "not. And those that sailed far came only to the new lands, \n",
      "and found them like to the old lands, and subject to death. \n",
      "And those that sailed furthest set but a girdle about the \n",
      "Earth and returned weary at last to the place of their \n",
      "beginning; and they said: \n",
      "\n",
      "'All roads are now bent.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus in after days, what by the voyages of ships, what \n",
      "by lore and star-craft, the kings of Men knew that the world \n",
      "was indeed made round, and yet the Eldar were permitted \n",
      "still to depart and to come to the Ancient West and to \n",
      "Avallone, if they would. Therefore the loremasters of Men \n",
      "said that a Straight Road must still be, for those that were \n",
      "permitted to find it. And they taught that, while the new world \n",
      "fell away, the old road and the path of the memory of the \n",
      "West still went on, as it were a mighty bridge invisible that \n",
      "passed through the air of breath and of flight (which were \n",
      "bent now as the world was bent), and traversed Ilmen which \n",
      "flesh unaided cannot endure, until it came to Tol Eressea, \n",
      "the Lonely Isle, and maybe even beyond, to Valinor, where \n",
      "the Valar still dwell and watch the unfolding of the story of \n",

      "When Manwe heard of the ways that Melkor had taken, \n",
      "it seemed plain to him that he purposed to escape to his \n",
      "old strongholds in the north of Middle-earth; and Orome and \n",
      "Tulkas went with all speed northward, seeking to overtake \n",
      "him if they might, but they found no trace or rumour of him \n",
      "beyond the shores of the Teleri, in the unpeopled wastes \n",
      "that drew near to the Ice. Thereafter the watch was \n",
      "redoubled along the northern fences of Aman; but to no \n",
      "purpose, for ere ever the pursuit set out Melkor had turned \n",
      "back, and in secrecy passed away far to the south. For he \n",
      "was yet as one of the Valar, and could change his form, or \n",
      "walk unclad, as could his brethren; though that power he \n",
      "was soon to lose for ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus unseen he came at last to the dark region of \n",
      "Avathar. That narrow land lay south of the Bay of Eldamar, \n",
      "beneath the eastern feet of the Pelori, and its long and \n",
      "mournful shores stretched away into the south, lightless and \n",
      "unexplored. There, beneath the sheer walls of the \n",
      "mountains and the cold dark sea, the shadows were \n",
      "deepest and thickest in the world; and there in Avathar, \n",
      "secret and unknown, Ungoliant had made her abode. The \n",
      "Eldar knew not whence she came; but some have said that \n",
      "in ages long before she descended from the darkness that \n",
      "lies about Arda, when Melkor first looked down in envy \n",
      "upon the Kingdom of Manwe, and that in the beginning she \n",
      "was one of those that he corrupted to his service. But she \n",
      "had disowned her Master, desiring to be mistress of her \n",
      "own lust, taking all things to herself to feed her emptiness; \n",
      "and she fled to the south, escaping the assaults of the Valar \n",
      "and the hunters of Orome, for their vigilance had ever been \n",
      "to the north, and the south was long unheeded. Thence she \n",
      "had crept towards the light of the Blessed Realm; for she \n",
      "hungered for light and hated it. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a ravine she lived, and took shape as a spider of \n",
      "monstrous form, weaving her black webs in a cleft of the \n",
      "mountains. There she sucked up all light that she could find, \n",
      "and spun it forth again in dark nets of strangling gloom, until \n",
      "no light more could come to her abode; and she was \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "famished. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Melkor came to Avathar and sought her out; and \n",
      "he put on again the form that he had worn as the tyrant of \n",
      "Utumno: a dark Lord, tall and terrible. In that form he \n",
      "remained ever after. There in the black shadows, beyond \n",
      "the sight even of Manwe in his highest halls, Melkor with \n",
      "Ungoliant plotted his revenge. But when Ungoliant \n",
      "understood the purpose of Melkor, she was torn between \n",
      "lust and great fear; for she was loath to dare the perils of \n",
      "Aman and the power of the dreadful Lords, and she would \n",
      "not stir from her hiding. Therefore Melkor said to her: 'Do \n",
      "as I bid; and if thou hunger still when all is done, then I will \n",
      "give thee whatsoever thy lust may demand. Yea, with both \n",
      "hands.' Lightly he made this vow, as he ever did; and he \n",
      "laughed in his heart. Thus did the great thief set his lure for \n",
      "the lesser. \n",
      "\n",
      "A cloak of darkness she wove about them when \n",
      "Melkor and Ungoliant set forth; an Unlight, in which things \n",
      "seemed to be no more, and which eyes could not pierce, \n",
      "for it was void. Then slowly she wrought her webs: rope by \n",
      "rope from cleft to cleft, from jutting rock to pinnacle of stone, \n",
      "ever climbing upwards, crawling and clinging, until at last \n",
      "she reached the very summit of Hyarmentir, the highest \n",
      "mountain in that region of the world, far south of great \n",
      "Taniquetil. There the Valar were not vigilant; for west of the \n",
      "Pelori was an empty land in twilight, and eastward the \n",
      "mountains looked out, save for forgotten Avathar, only upon \n",
      "the dim waters of the pathless sea. But now upon the \n",
      "mountain-top dark Ungoliant lay; and she made a ladder of \n",
      "woven ropes and cast it down, and Melkor climbed upon it \n",
      "and came to that high place, and stood beside her, looking \n",
      "down upon the Guarded Realm. Below them lay the woods \n",
      "of Orome, and westward shimmered the fields and \n",
      "pastures of Yavanna, gold beneath the tall wheat of the \n",
      "gods. Bat Melkor looked north, and saw afar the shining \n",
      "plain, and the silver domes of Valmar gleaming in the \n",
      "mingling of the lights of Telperion and Laurelin. Then Melkor \n",
      "laughed aloud, and leapt swiftly down the long western \n",
      "slopes; and Ungoliant was at his side, and her darkness \n",
      "covered them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now it was a time of festival, as Melkor knew well. \n",
      "Though all tides and seasons were at the will of the Valar, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and in Valinor there was no winter of death, nonetheless \n",
      "they dwelt then in the Kingdom of Arda, and that was but a \n",
      "small realm in the halls of Ea, whose life is Time, which \n",
      "flows ever from the first note to the last chord of Eru. And \n",
      "even as it was then the delight of the Valar (as is told in the \n",
      "Ainulindale) to clothe themselves as in a vesture in the \n",
      "forms of the Children of lluvatar, so also did they eat and \n",
      "drink, and gather the fruits of Yavanna from the Earth, which \n",
      "under Eru they had made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Yavanna set times for the flowering and the \n",
      "ripening of all things mat grew in Valinor; and at each first \n",
      "gathering of fruits Manwe made a high feast for the praising \n",
      "of Eru, when all the peoples of Valinor poured forth their joy \n",
      "in music and song upon Taniquetil. This now was the hour, \n",
      "and Manwe decreed a feast more glorious than any that \n",
      "had been held since the coming of the Eldar to Aman. For \n",
      "though the escape of Melkor portended toils and sorrows to \n",
      "come, and indeed none could tell what further hurts would \n",
      "be done to Arda ere he could be subdued again, at this \n",
      "time Manwe designed to heal the evil that had arisen \n",
      "among the Noldor; and all were bidden to come to his halls \n",
      "upon Taniquetil, there to put aside the griefs that lay \n",
      "between their princes, and forget utterly the lies of their \n",
      "Enemy. There came the Vanyar, and there came the Noldor \n",
      "of Tirion, and the Maiar were gathered together, and the \n",
      "Valar were arrayed in their beauty and majesty; and they \n",
      "sang before Manwe and Varda in their lofty halls, or danced \n",
      "upon the green slopes of the Mountain that looked west \n",
      "towards the Trees. In that day the streets of Valmar were \n",
      "empty, and the stairs of Tirion were silent; and all the land \n",
      "lay sleeping in peace. Only the Teleri beyond the mountains \n",
      "still sang upon the shores of the sea; for they recked little of \n",
      "seasons or times, and gave no thought to the cares of the \n",
      "Rulers of Arda, or the shadow that had fallen on Valinor, for \n",
      "it had not touched them, as yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing only marred the design of Manwe. Feanor \n",
      "came indeed, for him alone Manwe had commanded to \n",
      "come; but Finwe came not, nor any others of the Noldor of \n",
      "Formenos. For said Finwe; 'While the ban lasts upon \n",
      "Feanor my son, that he may not go to Tirion, I hold myself \n",
      "unkinged, and I will not meet my people.' And Feanor came \n",
      "not in raiment of festival, and he wore no ornament, neither \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "silver nor gold nor any gem; and he denied the sight of the \n",
      "Silmarils to the Valar and the Eldar, and left them locked in \n",
      "Formenos in their chamber of iron. Nevertheless he met \n",
      "Fingolfin before the throne of Manwe, and was reconciled, \n",
      "in word; and Fingolfin set at naught the unsheathing of the \n",
      "sword. For Fingolfin held forth his hand, saying: 'As I \n",
      "promised, I do now. I release thee, and remember no \n",
      "grievance.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Feanor took his hand in silence; but Fingolfin \n",
      "said: 'Half-brother in blood, full brother in heart will I be. \n",
      "Thou shalt lead and I will follow. May no new grief divide as.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'I hear thee,' said Feanor. 'So be it.' But they did not \n",
      "know the meaning that their words would bear. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that even as Feanor and Fingolfin stood \n",
      "before Manwe there came the mingling of the lights, when \n",
      "both Trees were shining, and the silent city of Valmar was \n",
      "filled with a radiance of silver and gold. And in that very \n",
      "hour Melkor and Ungoliant came hastening over the fields \n",
      "of Valinor, as the shadow of a black cloud upon the wind \n",
      "fleets over the sunlit earth; and they came before the green \n",
      "mound Ezellohar. Then the Unlight of Ungoliant rose up \n",
      "even to the roots of the Trees, and Melkor sprang upon the \n",
      "mound; and with his black spear he smote each Tree to its \n",
      "core, wounded them deep, and their sap poured forth as it \n",
      "were their blood, and was spilled upon the ground. But \n",
      "Ungoliant sucked it up, and going then from Tree to Tree \n",
      "she set her black beak to their wounds, till they were \n",
      "drained; and the poison of Death that was in her went into \n",
      "their tissues and withered them, root, branch, and leaf; and \n",
      "they died. And still she thirsted, and going to the Wells of \n",
      "Varda she drank them dry; but Ungoliant belched forth \n",
      "black vapours as she drank, and swelled to a shape so \n",
      "vast and hideous that Melkor was afraid. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the great darkness fell upon Valinor. Of the deeds \n",
      "of that day much is told in the Aldudenie, that Elemmire of \n",
      "the Vanyar made and is known to all the Eldar. Yet no song \n",
      "or tale could contain all the grief and terror that then befell. \n",
      "The Light failed; but the Darkness that followed was more \n",
      "than loss of light. In that hour was made a Darkness that \n",
      "seemed not lack but a thing with being of its own: for it was \n",
      "indeed made by malice out of Light, and it had power to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "pierce the eye, and to enter heart and mind, and strangle \n",
      "the very will. \n",
      "\n",
      "Varda looked down from Taniquetil, and beheld the \n",
      "Shadow soaring up in sudden towers of gloom; Valmar had \n",
      "foundered in a deep sea of night. Soon the Holy Mountain \n",
      "stood alone, a last island in a world that was drowned. All \n",
      "song ceased. There was silence in Valinor, and no sound \n",
      "could be heard, save only from afar there came on the wind \n",
      "through the pass of the mountains the wailing of the Teleri \n",
      "like the cold cry of gulls. For it blew chill from the East in \n",
      "that hour, and the vast shadows of the sea were rolled \n",
      "against the walls of the shore. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Manwe from his high seat looked out, and his eyes \n",
      "alone pierced through the night, until they saw a Darkness \n",
      "beyond dark which they could not penetrate, huge but far \n",
      "away, moving now northward with great speed; and he \n",
      "knew that Melkor had come and gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the pursuit was begun; and the earth shook \n",
      "beneath the horses of the host of Orome, and the fire that \n",
      "was stricken from the hooves of Nahar was the first light \n",
      "that returned to Valinor. But so soon as any came up with \n",
      "the Cloud of Ungoliant the riders of the Valar were blinded \n",
      "and dismayed, and they were scattered, and went they \n",
      "knew not whither; and the sound of the Valaroma faltered \n",
      "and failed. And Tulkas was as one caught in a black net at \n",
      "night, and he stood powerless and beat the air in vain. But \n",
      "when the Darkness had passed, it was too late: Melkor had \n",
      "gone whither he would, and his vengeance was achieved. \n"
