# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Natural Langauge Processing 
Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is within the field of linguistics and refers to a set of techniques for manipulation of natural language, such as speech and text, using software. NLP is a sub-branch of data science and has many applications, though it has been particularly useful in the healthcare industry, with the increased use of Electronic Health Records (EHR). For example, we can now predict risk for suicide and suicidal ideation by applying NLP to EHR's ([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25773-2)). Companies can apply NLP to social media or product reviews, in order to understand their customers better and ultimately offer a better product or service ([2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309691845_A_Review_of_Natural_Language_Processing_Techniques_for_Opinion_Mining_Systems)). Since I don't have ready access to EHR's, I've decided to do this NLP project on one of my favorite books, "The Silmarillion", by J.R.R. Tolkien.
