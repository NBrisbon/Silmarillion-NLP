# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Natural Langauge Processing 
Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is within the field of linguistics and refers to a set of techniques for manipulation of natural language, such as speech and text, using software. NLP is a sub-branch of data science and has many applications, though it has been particularly useful in the healthcare industry, with the increased use of Electronic Health Records (EHR). For example, we can now predict risk for suicide and suicidal ideation by applying NLP to EHR's ([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25773-2)). Companies can apply NLP to social media or product reviews, in order to understand their customers better and ultimately offer a better product or service ([2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309691845_A_Review_of_Natural_Language_Processing_Techniques_for_Opinion_Mining_Systems)). Since I don't have ready access to EHR's, I've decided to do this NLP project on one of my favorite books, *The Silmarillion*, by J.R.R. Tolkien. 

## 1.2 The Silmarillion
When people hear of J.R.R. Tolkien, his book *The Silmarillion* is typically not the first that comes to mind. After all, it's difficult to compete with books like *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, as both are far easier to read and have big budget Hollywood films tied to them. Still, *The Silmarillion* holds a special place in my heart. It lays the foundation for Middle-earth and sets the stage for the more popular books in Tolkien's catalogue. The book is incredibly dense, content-wise, and written in a formal and archaic style, more similar to the Bible than *The Lord of the Rings*. It's challenging and some find it impenetrable. Though, I can't recommend it more to fans of fantasy and for Tolkien fans, it's simply essential reading. 

Having read both *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* at a very early age, I admit to having avoided *The Silmarillion* until about 10 years ago. I was part of a seminar of about 30 other geeks who met online bi-weekly to discuss each chapter in detail. The seminar was later released as a podcast ([3](https://tolkienprofessor.com/lectures/courses/silmarillion-seminar/))([4](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/the-silmarillion-seminar/id599723153)), and for anyone planning to read the book....maybe it will help!

# 2 Data
The full text of *The Silmarillion* used in this project is accessible here ([5](https://archive.org/stream/fegmcfeggerson_gmail_4731/473%20%281%29_djvu.txt)). After scraping the webpage and cleaning the text, I extracted the entire text and the text for each seperate chapter and created a PANDAS dataframe. I then used the modules NLTK and Text Blob to extract some basic information from the text and then the modules Text Blob, VADER, and the NRC Emotion Lexicon to perform sentiment analyses by chapter. All values for sentiment analyses and descriptive text analyses were added to the dataframe, pictured below.

# 3 Text Analysis
## 3.1 Word Cloud 
Using the Natural Language Toolkit module ([NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)), I first "tokenized" each word from the book, extracting each "token" and removing all whitespace, punctuation, etc. Then, I made all tokens lower-case for consistency and removed "stop-words." Stopwords are refered to as the words in a text that don't particularly convey significant meaning, such as "the", "in", and "a". Finally, I got the frequency of each word, or toke, and then created a "word cloud" of the most frequently used words superimposed over a shield (much easier than to superimpose over a sword!).

## 3.2 Most Frequent Nouns
Again, using NLTK, I conducted the same preliminary text manipulation as above (toekize, lower-case, and stopwords) on each separate chapter. Following this, I used NLTK to tag the different parts of speech for each word. This tags each word in the text with its part of speech, for example "NN" for noun and "VB" for verb. The top 10 most frequent nouns were extracted for each chapter and appear on the table below. This helps give a sense of what each chapter is about. For example, the *AinulindalÃ«* is a Creation story of the origin of the universe. The Ainur are spiritual beings, akin to angels, who sing a vision of the universe into existence based on a theme given to them by Iluvatar (God). Melkor is one of the Ainur and the most powerful and knowledgable of them all. He broke from the harmony and developed his own song, causing discord in the overall theme. After some struggle, Iluvatar stopped the music and showed them the world they had created which was before just a vision. As you can see, the top 10 nouns for this chapter strongly reflect the summary just given.
